/*b) Bank Management System:
        * Create a Bank Management System which has the following components:
        * Person (which saves first, middle and last name, age and a "social security number")
        * Bank (which saves a List of customers and their Checking Accounts, maximum overdraw amount)
        * Checking Account (should have a current value, methods for taking and depositing money)
        * Opening a Checking Account should only work via a Bank and must require a certain amount of initial deposit.
        *
        * BONUS: Make the Banking System Interactive (No Solution provided!)*/
